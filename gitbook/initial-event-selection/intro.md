# Introduction

_The BOSS Afterburner_ repository is meant as an extension of the conventional BOSS analysis framework. It contains the tutorial pages you are currently looking at, but also comes with two major components that are to facilitate initial and final event selection.

First of all, there is the _base-derived algorithm structure_. This framework is an advanced version of the `Rhopi` algorithm: a framework for [**initial event selection**]().

Like `RhopiAlg`, output of this initial event selection is a ROOT file containing a set of `TTree`s. Usually, you then design your own scripts from scratch to load, apply additional cuts, plot, and then fit the data in there. This is where the second part of this repository comes in: the framework for [**final event selection**](../final-event-selection/final.md), or the "Afterburner".

In the following pages, we will first go through the motivation for designing this layer outside of the BOSS analysis framework and then go through these two components of event selection. We will end with a note on contributing to this framework, because one of the main aims of this setup is **to facilitate collaboration on analysis code within BESIII**.

## Motivation

The BOSS Afterburner comes with initial event selection packages that follow an object-oriented design: all functionality that is shared by all \(light hadron\) analyses are shared through the [`TrackSelector`](https://redeboer.github.io/BOSS_Afterburner/classTrackSelector.html) base algorithm, while the user is to further specialise the analysis in derived algorithms \(such as [`D0phi_KpiKK`](https://redeboer.github.io/BOSS_Afterburner/classD0phi__KpiKK.html)\).

Some aims of this setup:

* Make event selection **easier to understand** for beginners. They should not have to reinvent the wheel.
* **Improve readability** of code for event selection packages. This is achieved through \(1\) encapsulating parts of the algorithm in class method and \(2\) following strict rules for code comments in Doxygen formatting. In this way, event selections become more accessible \(both through Doxygen pages and the code structure\) for readers or reviewers who are not familiar with the aims and procedures of certain event selection packages.
* Provide a platform for **collaborating** on code, while still doing one's own specific research. The user is has the freedom and flexibility to design the event selection to one's own needs \(in the derived algorithms\), but is at the same time continuously testing the functionality of the base classes.
* Future plans:
  * **Standardized output** of plots such as default plot labels, automatised naming, watermarks for the status of your analysis, etc.
  * **Unit tests** that ensure the consistency and reliability of analysis output after framework updates. See for instance [`CppTest`](https://redeboer.gitbook.io/afterburner).

### Facilitate collaboration

{% hint style="info" %}

_Argument sketch_

#### The usual setup

* Some observations:
  * Version control, modulation, and code collaboration is limited to the core of BOSS
  * Code for event selections is designed individually
  * This is done from scratch using e.g. the `RhopiAlg`package
* Problems and hazards:
  * Always having to reinvent the wheel
  * Copy-paste coding from examples
  * Lack of standard tools, e.g. for job creation
  * No standard, formalised procedures: risk of unreliable and results that cannot be reproduced

#### Solution: modulation

* Shared functionality through a **base class** and keep the specifics of your own analysis in  a **derived classes**
* Advantages:
  * Algorithm steps modulated through class methods:
    * Improves overview on what the algorithm does
    * Allows for easy, framework-wide fixes/upgrades
    * Allows for implementation of performance tests \(e.g. to check whether updates do not affect output\)
    * Allows for accessible documentation
  * Shared functionality can be made available to everyone through the base class
  * Derived algorithm only contains what is relevant for your own analysis, the rest is taken care of by the base class
  * All of the above facilitates collaboration!

### Problems with booking procedures

#### `NTuple` booking procedure

The typical booking procedure [used in for instance the `RhopiAlg`]() is not the most convenient. It requires many steps, so it is easy to make a mistake when you modify your code. An overview of the procedure:

1. _In the header file:_ **Declaration** of the [`NTuple::Tuple`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classNTuple_1_1Tuple.html) pointer \(eventual `TTree`\) and [`NTuple::Item`s](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classNTuple_1_1Item.html) \(eventual branches\) in the header file. This is required because you need a memory address \(branch\) to which you store values and then [write](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classINTuple.html#a89cd8df7b0cff68a1cbb45d9c8fe7df5) them.
2. _In the_ `initialize` _step:_ **Book** the `NTuple::Tuple` in the output file using [`Algorithm::ntupleSvc`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classAlgorithm.html#aa0e741efefa5312b20f9a213c3ab4cbb). Here, you also determine the name of the eventual `TTree`.
3. **Add** the `NTuple::Item` s \(branches\) to their branches using [`NTuple::Tuple::addItem`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classNTuple_1_1Tuple.html#a78033967fbd89f7f18e7d6d7d43f41ac). Here, you determine the names of the eventual branches. _Note that this procedure can become complicated and difficult to modulate when using indexed items._

#### Declaring properties

[Similarly to booking the `NTuple`s](intro.md#ntuple-booking-procedure), declaring package properties is not too convenient either. An overview:

1. **Declaration** of memory addresses in the header file, such as `double`s for cuts and `bool`leans for switches.
2. **Declaring the property** in the constructor using [`Algorithm::declareProperty`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classAlgorithm.html#acc63d83555ffb3833df7334468551d7d). Here you assign a name to the property. It is inconvenient that you have to go back and forth between the header file and the source code to keep the declared properties in agreement with the declared memory addresses.
3. _For_ `bool` _switches:_ Typically, the `bool`properties are used to decide whether or not to book and write certain `NTuple`s, so you have to use them again in the `initialize`  and `execute` steps. It would therefore be nice if these `bool` switch properties are declared automatically along with the corresponding `NTuple`s.

#### Setup in `TrackSelector`

The `NTuple` and property procedures and relations described above suggest the design of a class structure that encapsulates everything. Ideally, you then just have to name these properties and `NTuple`s in the constructor so that you instantly have a nice overview of all of them there and can easily modify your code.

There is however a challenge due to the structure of the Gaudi framework: the essential functions [`Algorithm::declareProperty`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classAlgorithm.html#acc63d83555ffb3833df7334468551d7d) and [`INTupleSvc::book`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classINTupleSvc.html#a501f6331df3de22c81e91f3f3f7704b6) require an instance of `Algorithm`, because they will have to be linked to the output ROOT file \(see for instance [`Algorithm::ntupleSvc`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classAlgorithm.html#aa0e741efefa5312b20f9a213c3ab4cbb)\). A solution would be to keep track of the all instances of the constructed encapsulation classes of `NTuple`s and properties using a `static`list of pointers. Methods defined in the `TrackSelector`then take care of the booking procedures automatically by looping over these lists for you and using the data members in these classes to perform all the steps required.

A problem remains the correspondence between names of the properties and `NTuple`s: you will have to call them later through the code and the question is how? That is, whether through their names, or through their instances.

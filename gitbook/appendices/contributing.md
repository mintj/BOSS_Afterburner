# Contributing

There are several means through which you can contribute to these tutorial pages or to the code in the repository itself.

* **Email** Just [email me]() if you see something that needs improvement or if there is something you would like to see documented.
* **Through GitBook** Using GitBook is the most convenient method to collaborate on the tutorial pages: you can comment, discuss, work with drafts, merge them, etc.
* **Through** `git` Contribute to both the tutorial pages and the code through `git`. For the tutorial pages, you will have to work with the MarkDown source files, but it allows for a larger number of collaborators.

In all cases, just [contact me](about.md) and I can give you access.

## Contributing through `git`

For this, you will have to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) \(you will be redirected if you already have one\). I can then add your account as a contributor. A [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/) will then be created for you in which you can change anything you want. If you would like to publish your changes to the master branch so that they become accessible for all.

See [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for a short tutorial about the `git` workflow.

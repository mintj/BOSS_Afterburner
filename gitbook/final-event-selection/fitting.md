## Ideas for a `RooFit` wrapper

Probably won't be developed in the _BOSS Afterburner_. For now, `RooFit` procedures are enveloped in the `CommonFunctions.h` header.

An example of a `RooFit` wrapper would be `RooRarFit` by the BaBar Collaboration:

* [Documentation HTML pages](http://hepwww.rl.ac.uk/fwilson/RooRarFit.html)
* Presentation on RooRarFit by Lei Zhang \(UC Riverside, 2007\)

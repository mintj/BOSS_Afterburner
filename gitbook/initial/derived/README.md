# Derived algorithms

The following pages focus on the derived packages currently available within _The BOSS Afterburner_. You can choose to skip these pages and move on to the [Final event selection](../../final/final.md).

Naming convention for the name of the derived algorithms is:

1. Start with the names of the primary decay products. No spaces and capitalise according to PDG names. Names like `gamma` can be abbreviated to `g`. In the case of `RhopiAlg` this becomes `rhopi`.
2. Add an underscore \(`_`\).
3. Continue with the names of the next state that is of interest to you. In the case of `RhopiAlg` this becomes `rhopi_pipigg`.
4. Continue with 2 and 3 until you reach the final state that is of interest to your analysis.

It might be that the above scheme is not sufficient for your analysis. Please [contact](../../appendices/about.md) if this is the case.

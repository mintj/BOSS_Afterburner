# Contents of the tutorial pages

This [GitBook](https://besiii.gitbook.io/boss) provides tutorials for using both the BOSS Analysis Framework used in the BESIII collaboration. Currently, the emphasis lies on \(light\) hadron analysis, but the tutorials can be useful for other forms of analysis as well. In addition, there are tutorials on the usage of some important BOSS packages. Towards the end of the tutorial, we will transition towards the usage of the tools provided by _The BOSS Afterburner_.

Here are shortcuts that you might want to take:

1. [**Getting started with BOSS**]() If you are not familiar with BOSS, it is best to start with this part of the tutorial. It will help you set up the BOSS environment in your account on the IHEP server \('install BOSS'\), explain you some basics of the package structure on which BOSS is built, and guide you through the process of submitting jobs.
2. [**Major BOSS packages**]() Here, you will find descriptions of some of the important BOSS packages used in initial event selection, most notably, the `RhopiAlg` package.
3. [_**BOSS Afterburner:**_ **Initial event selection**]() Here, we depart from the basic procedures when using BOSS and introduce the base-derived algorithm structure that comes with _The BOSS Afterburner_. This algorithm structure is, however, still a component of BOSS and is in essence an upgrade of the `Rhopi` algorithm. From this part of the tutorial on, you will have to clone the repository to your account on the IHEP server and/or to your own computer.
4. [_**BOSS Afterburner:**_ **Final event selection**](final-event-selection/final.md) In this final part, we look at how to process the output of the BOSS framework \(the initial event selection\). The tutorial describes the usage of the framework for final event selection that comes with _The BOSS Afterburner._
5. [**Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting**](appendices/tips.md) These pages are used to collect problems that are frequently encountered when working with BOSS. As such, these notes are useful no matter your level. _New suggestions are most welcome!_

What goes for all of the above is that, whatever your background or level, **your feedback is extremely valuable**. These tutorial pages are quite new and need testing and improvement.

In fact, you can contribute to these pages yourself! Contact details can be found [here](appendices/about.md).

# The 'quick' folder

This folder contains simple `ROOT` scripts that can be used as a quick way to produce results. The `.set` files can be used to set parameters during runtime. This allows you to quickly tweak parameters.

Note that ideally, the scripts written here are run in one command line only. **Automatisation is vital for reproducability.**

Another purpose of this folder is to test new functionality. As such, functionality that is developed in the 'quick' scripts here should be implemented in the final analysis framework of the *BOSS Afterburner*.
